## Road Map and Getting Involved

<img src="assets/images/Cornucopia-card-authentication-7.png" alt="Cornucopia Card Authentication - 7" class="fa-pull-right" style="padding:1em;background-color:#dddddd;margin:0 0 1em 2em;">

Involvement in the development and promotion of Cornucopia is actively encouraged! You do not have to be a security expert in order to contribute. Some of the ways you can help are listed below.

### Localization

Are you fluent in another language? Can you help translate Cornucopia into that language? Niote tthis is a very large task due to the number of documents involved.

### Use and Promote the Cornucopia Card Decks

Please help raise awareness of Cornucopia by printing cards:
* Use Cornucopia with specifiers, architects, designers, developers, testers and others, in part to train them, but also to solicit feedback on their usability, practicality and appropriateness for their work
* Create video about how to play the game
* Develop a mobile app to play the game

### Feedback

Please use the friendly project [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/cornucopia-project) for feedback:

* What do like?
* What don't you like?
* What cards don't make sense?
* How could the guidance be improved?
* What other decks would you like to see?

### Keep the Cards Updated

As the source referenced documents change, we have to update the decks. You may also find errors and omissions. In the first instance, please send a message to the project's [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/cornucopia-project) if you have identified errors & omissions, have some time to maintain the source documents, or can help in other ways.

### Create a New Deck

The only version currently available is the Cornucopia Ecommerce Website Edition in English. We would like to create a new mobile app specific deck, probably using the wonderful OWASP Mobile Security Project as inspiration for the card source materials. Do you have an idea for your own application security requirements card deck? Perhaps for mobile apps or something else?
