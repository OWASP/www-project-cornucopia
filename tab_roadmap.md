## Road Map and Getting Involved

Involvement in the development and promotion of Cornucopia is actively encouraged! You do not have to be a security expert in order to contribute. Some of the ways you can help are listed below.

### Localization

Are you fluent in another language? Can you help translate Cornucopia into that language? Note tthis is a very large task due to the number of documents involved, but the strings are now all available in textual data files.

### Use and Promote the Cornucopia Card Decks

Please help raise awareness of Cornucopia by:
* Printing dcks of cards and giving them away
* Using Cornucopia with specifiers, architects, designers, developers, testers and others, in part to train them, but also to solicit feedback on their usability, practicality and appropriateness for their work
* Creating videos about how to play the game
* Developing a mobile app to play the game

### Feedback

Please use the friendly project [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/cornucopia-project) for feedback:

* What do like?
* What don't you like?
* What cards don't make sense?
* How could the guidance be improved?
* What other decks would you like to see?

### Keep the Cards Updated

As the source referenced documents change, we have to update the decks. You may also find errors and omissions. In the first instance, please send a message to the project's [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/cornucopia-project) if you have identified errors & omissions, have some time to maintain the source documents, or can help in other ways.

### Create a New Deck

The first deck is the Cornucopia Ecommerce Website Edition, and is currently available in six languages. There is a mobile app specific deck in progress. Do you have an idea for your own application security requirements card deck?
