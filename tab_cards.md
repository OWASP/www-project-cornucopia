The primary source document is a [Word document](https://github.com/OWASP/cornucopia/releases/tag/v2.0.0). 

However, pre-printed card decks may be more useful, or there are links to the source design files for the cards themselves (see links underneath).
You can also choose to play the OWASP Cornucopia Website App Edition and Mobile App Edition online at [copi.owasp.org](https://copi.owasp.org)

### Printed

OWASP no longer has a stock of printed decks.

OWASP does not endorse or recommend commercial products or services. However, [Agile Stationary](https://agilestationery.co.uk/) offer [large print (v2.0) web app decks](https://agilestationery.com/products/owasp-cornucopia-2-0-website-app-edition-threat-modeling-cards?_pos=2&_psq=cornucipia&_ss=e&_v=1.0) and [large print (v1.0) mobile app decks](https://agilestationery.com/products/owasp-cornucopia-mobile-app-edition-threat-modeling-cards?_pos=3&_psq=cornucip&_ss=e&_v=1.0). They also offer a [croupier](https://croupier.agilestationery.co.uk/) to help you distribute cards to team members. Also, [dotNET lab](https://www.dotnetlab.eu/) sell a [printed deck](https://webshop.dotnetlab.eu/product/cornucopia-card-deck/) which complements their [online reference](https://cornucopia.dotnetlab.eu/cards).

### Print your own

There are many ways to print copies of the card decks yourself:

1. Download the free Adobe Illustrator files and get them professionally printed;
1. Print the Word document onto business card blanks;
1. Print the Word document onto normal card and cut the cards out individually using the guide; or
1. Generate your own cards from the free source XML data file in the repository.

For instructions on printing your own decks, please go to [cornucopia.owasp.org](https://cornucopia.owasp.org/printing)

### Source files

Source code to generate the Word document, PDFs and InDesign files for printing are maintained in our [Github repository](https://github.com/OWASP/cornucopia/releases)
