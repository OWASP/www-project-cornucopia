OWASP Cornucopia is a mechanism in the form of a card game to assist software development teams identify security requirements in Agile, conventional and formal development processes. It is language, platform and technology-agnostic.

## Introduction
The idea behind Cornucopia is to help development teams, especially those using Agile methodologies, to identify application security requirements and develop security-based user stories. Although the idea had been waiting for enough time to progress it, the final motivation came when [SAFECode](http://www.safecode.org/) published its [Practical Security Stories and Security Tasks for Agile Development Environments](https://safecode.org/publication/SAFECode_Agile_Dev_Security0712.pdf) in July 2012. Cornucopia was created and first used for developer training in August 2012.
